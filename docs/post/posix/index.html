<p>This workshop is for programmers and scientists with a basic background in C programming, who want to increase the flexibility and responsiveness of their code and take advantage of modern multicore and multi-threaded computer architectures. It is an introduction to the Posix Thread Library and its application to the parallelization of C programs. We assume no prior knowledge of multithreading or parallel programming, but some background in Unix operating systems and programming in C will be necessary. The lectures include demonstrations of example programs on a multicore machine. The following subjects will be</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Parallel Programming and Multithreading</p></li>

<li><p>The Posix Thread Library, Basics of Thread Programming</p></li>

<li><p>Creating and Manipulating of Threads</p></li>

<li><p>Synchronization, Locks and Condition Variables</p></li>

<li><p>Thread-Specific Data and Destructors</p></li>
</ul>
