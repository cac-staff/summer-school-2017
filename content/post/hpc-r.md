The R programming language has become the standard tool for data science, statistics, and bioinformatics. This course focuses on making your R code as fast as possible, including topics on performance optimization and parallelization. There will be a major emphasis on newer additions to the language, in particular, the “tidyverse” set of packages.

## Prerequisites

Please come to the workshop with both [R](https://www.r-project.org/) 
and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) installed.
You may also wish to pre-install the `tidyverse` set of R packages with
`install.packages("tidyverse")`.
