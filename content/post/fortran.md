The Fortran programming language was one of the first “high level” languages, and it has been around since the 1950's. Despite it being declared so many times, it is far from dead, and a great number of important technical computing packages are written and maintained in it. Fortran is specifically geared toward numerical computing and the development of scientific and engineering applications. Due to its structural simplicity, it also naturally supports efficient execution and thus is very suitable for "high-performance" computing.

As Fortran is not the most popular of current computing languages, it is not as common as it used to be for scientists and engineers to have a background in this language. This is an opportunity to familiarize yourself with the basic concepts and features of Fortran 90, such as modules, memory allocation, array operation, and routine overloading.
