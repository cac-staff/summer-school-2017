Python is perhaps the most versatile programming language in existence, and sees widespread use in every field of modern computing. This tutorial focuses on Python for high-performance computing applications, and will include topics on performance optimization, parallel programming, and pipelining. The afternoon session will focus on using Python to (easily) write and scale massively parallel data analysis pipelines across a cluster.
