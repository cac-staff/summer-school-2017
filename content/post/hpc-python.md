Python is perhaps the most versatile programming language in existence, and sees widespread use in every field of modern computing. This tutorial focuses on Python for high-performance computing applications, and will include topics on performance optimization, parallel programming, and pipelining. The afternoon session will focus on using Python to (easily) write and scale massively parallel data analysis pipelines across a cluster. 

## Prerequisites

Please come to the course with some variant of Python 3 installed
as well as your favorite text editor / IDE.
If you do not know what to install, we recommend [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads),
an extremely comprehensive Python distribution that includes most key packages you will need.
