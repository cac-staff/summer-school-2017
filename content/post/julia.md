Julia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language for numerical computing. It provides a compiler, parallel execution, numerical accuracy, and a mathematical function library. It also integrates open source C and Fortran libraries for linear algebra, random number generation, signal processing, and string processing. It aims to combine the simplicity and accessibility of environments such as R and Python with the execution speed and efficiency of programming languages such as Fortran or C++.

This workshop is meant as a basic introduction to Programming in Julia. It offers a starting point for further exploration of the language, and enables users with little or no programming background to write simple but functional programs.
