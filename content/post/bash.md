This class serves as an introduction to Linux, 
the UNIX-like operating system that runs on almost all high-performance computing systems. 
It is intended for users who have little or no experience with Unix or Linux. 
The focus is on the common bash shell. 
We cover material that helps the user to develop an understanding of the Linux command-line environment, 
which is necessary for successful use of Unix. 

Topics covered include:

* Moving around and looking at things

* Writing and reading files

* Wildcards and piping

* Shell scripts, variables, and loops

* Working remotely on an HPC cluster
